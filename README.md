# RadixView

Welcome to the **RadixView** repository! This project offers an interactive and visually engaging representation of the Radix Sort algorithm. Powered by GSAP, it showcases dynamic animations that help users visualize the sorting process step by step, with smooth transitions for arrays and buckets. 

## Purpose

The primary aim of this repository is to provide an immersive and educational experience of the Radix Sort algorithm through captivating animations. Key objectives include:

- Demonstrating the **Radix Sort algorithm** in an intuitive and visually appealing manner.
- Enhancing understanding of sorting algorithms through **step-by-step visualizations**.
- Utilizing **GSAP animations** to illustrate changes in arrays and buckets during the sorting process.
- Creating a **dynamic and responsive layout** to ensure a smooth user experience across devices.
- Offering an **interactive interface** where users can control the sorting process and observe each step.
- Explaining the algorithm with **code and text**.

## Technologies

This project utilizes the following tools and technologies:

- **HTML5**: For structuring the interface and displaying the visualization.
- **CSS3**: For styling the page and ensuring a responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the Radix Sort logic and controlling the flow of the animation.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: To create smooth and engaging animations for the sorting process.
- **Highlight.js**: To color code blocks.
- **SVG Elements**: To display visual representations of the arrays and buckets.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch the Radix Sort algorithm sort an array with real-time updates and smooth transitions.
- **GSAP Animations**: Dynamic animations highlight each step of the sorting process, making it easy to follow along.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Step-by-Step Control**: Users can control the animation flow and observe each stage of the sorting process.
- **Customizable Array**: You can input custom values to sort and see how the algorithm performs on different datasets.
